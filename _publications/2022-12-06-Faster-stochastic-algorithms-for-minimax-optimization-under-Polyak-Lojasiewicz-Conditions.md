excerpt: 'This paper considers stochastic first-order algorithms for minimax optimization under Polyak-Łojasiewicz conditions. We propose SPIDER-GDA for solving the finite-sum problem and an accelerated algorithm for the ill-conditioned case, which achieves a better stochastic first-oreder oracle complexity'
