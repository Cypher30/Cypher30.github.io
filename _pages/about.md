# About Me

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in the [Oden Institute](https://www.oden.utexas.edu) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu),
where I am advised by Prof. [Omar Ghattas](https://oden.utexas.edu/people/directory/Omar-Ghattas/).
Currently, my research interests live at scientific machine learning and high performance computing.

I received my B.S. from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) in 2023, where I majored in data science.
I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Meiyue Shao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yk0MnRQAAAAJ&hl=en),
which is the reason I chose to pursue my Ph.D. in computational science.
